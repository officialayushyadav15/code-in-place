# Joke Bot

## Problem Statement

Write a simple **joke bot**. The bot starts by asking the user what they want.  
However, your program will only respond to **one** response: `Joke`.

If the user types anything other than "Joke", the bot ignores the request and asks again.  
Once the user types `Joke`, the bot replies with a joke and ends.

This program should run in a loop until the user types the exact word `Joke` (case-sensitive).

You can solve this using the Karel programming environment provided in Stanford's *Code in Place* course.
