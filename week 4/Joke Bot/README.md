# Joke Bot

## Problem Statement

Write a simple joke bot. The bot starts by asking the user what they want. However, your program will only respond to one response: `Joke`.

If the user types `Joke`, your bot should respond with a funny line. For any other response, the bot should say something like "Sorry, I only tell jokes."
