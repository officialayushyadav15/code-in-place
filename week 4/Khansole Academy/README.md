# Khansole Academy

## Problem Statement

In **Code in Place**, we are all about building technology to help folks learn. Now it is your turn.

Implement **Khansole Academy** â€” a program that helps other people learn addition!

Write a program that randomly generates a simple addition problem for the user, reads in the answer from the user, and then checks to see if they got it right or wrong.


- The program should generate two random **2-digit integers** (i.e., values between **10 and 99**).
- It should then **display the addition problem** to the user.
- The user inputs their answer.
- The program **compares** the user's answer with the correct result.
- It prints whether the user is **correct or incorrect**, and shows the right answer if they got it wrong.
