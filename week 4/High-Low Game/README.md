# High-Low Game

## Problem Statement

We want you to gain more experience working with control flow and Booleans in Python. To do this, we are going to have you develop a game! The game is called **High-Low** and the way it's played goes as follows:

- Two numbers are generated from 1 to 100 (inclusive on both ends): one for you and one for a computer, who will be your opponent.  
- You get to see your number, but not the computer's!  
- You make a guess, saying your number is either higher than or lower than the computer's number.  
- If your guess matches the truth (e.g. you guess your number is higher, and your number is actually higher than the computer's), you get a point!

These steps make up one round of the game.  
The game is over after all rounds have been played.
