# Hofstadter's Sequence

## Problem Statement

Douglas Hofstadter’s Pulitzer-prize-winning book *Gödel, Escher, Bach* contains many intriguing mathematical puzzles, including this one from Chapter XII:

1. Pick a positive integer `n`.
2. If `n` is even, divide it by 2.
3. If `n` is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1.
4. Repeat this process until `n` becomes 1.

Your task is to write a program that performs this sequence for any starting number and prints each value of `n` along the way.
