# [Nimm: Ancient Game of Stones]

## Problem Statement

Nimm is an ancient game of strategy that is named after the old German word for "take." It is also called *Tiouk Tiouk* in West Africa and *Tsynshidzi* in China. Players alternate taking stones until there are none left. The game of Nimm follows these rules:

- The game starts with a pile of **20 stones** between the two players.
- Players take turns removing stones from the pile.
- On each turn, a player may take **either 1 or 2 stones**.
- The players continue alternating turns until the pile is empty.
- The **player who takes the last stone loses** the game.

Write a program to simulate the game of Nimm. You should prompt the user (Player 1) to choose how many stones to take (1 or 2), then let the computer (Player 2) make a move. The game continues until all stones are taken. At the end, print who lost the game.

You can solve this using the Python programming environment provided in Stanford's Code in Place course.
